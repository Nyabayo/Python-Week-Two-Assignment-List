# Week Two Assignment PLP

This repository contains Python code for a basic assignment that involves manipulating a list. The provided Python script performs the following operations on a list called `my_list`:

1. **Create an empty list called my_list.**
    ```python
    my_list = []
    ```

2. **Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.**
    ```python
    my_list.append(10)
    my_list.append(20)
    my_list.append(30)
    my_list.append(40)
    ```

3. **Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.**
    ```python
    my_list.insert(1, 15)
    ```

4. **Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].**
    ```python
    my_list.extend([50, 60, 70])
    ```

5. **Remove the last element from my_list.**
    ```python
    my_list.pop()
    ```

6. **Sort my_list in ascending order.**
    ```python
    my_list.sort()
    ```

7. **Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.**
    ```python
    index_of_30 = my_list.index(30)
    print("Index of 30 in my_list:", index_of_30)
    ```

8. **Print the final state of my_list.**
    ```python
    print("Final state of my_list:", my_list)
    ```
